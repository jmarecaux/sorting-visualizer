Use the top bar to control the length of the array and the animation speed.

I was inspired to create this sorting visualizer for the most common sorting algorithms. I had a great time doing so and learned
much about how these algorithms work as well as how they are implemented using React. Upon completion I spent almost as much time
playing around with it as I did writing it!
